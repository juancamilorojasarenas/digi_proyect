# SCP API Repository

This repository builds and contains the SCP Data Website.

It uses the [SCP Crawler](https://github.com/scp-data/scp_crawler) project with a Github Action to publish the SCP Datasets to Github Pages. The data can also be used directly by cloning this repository.

Data is kept in the [docs](./docs) subfolder, which has its own readme describing the data structure.
